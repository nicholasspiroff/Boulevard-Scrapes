This is a great transitional piece, perfect for outdoor adventures like hiking and camping, but doesn't look like your traditional outdated short that we've seen for years. It has a modern cut and zippered pockets, which are great for travel and big enough to hold passports, phones and other valuables. We designed the Ripstop Climber Short with our four-way stretch ripstop cotton for added durability and a three-piece gusset for mobility.
